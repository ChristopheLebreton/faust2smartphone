# Faust iOS API

This API allows to interact with a Faust object and its associated audio engine on iOS at a high level. The idea is that all the audio part of the app is implemented in Faust allowing developers to focus on the design of the app itself. 

This api keep most funtions of "faust2api -ios", for more details, check that documentation.

### App Set-Up

Very little work has to be done to integrate this package to your iOS app.

First, in your app configuration in XCode, make sure that the `AudioToolbox` framework is imported in `TARGETS/YouApp/BuildPhases/Link Binary With Libraries`. If you used the `-midi` option when generating the API, you'll also have to import the `CoreMIDI` framework.

Import `DspFaust.h` and `DspFaust.cpp` in your project (this can be done simply by dragging these files in your project tree). Then, import `DspFaust.h` (`#import "DspFaust.h"`) in the file where you want to create/control the Faust object (e.g. your main ViewController). Make sure that the file where you import `DspFaust.h` has the `.mm` extension (this is necessary to be able to use C++ code in your objective-c file).

****If using libOSCFaust:****

    add the source folder /osclib in Xcode project and link as well as in seaching header files.

### Using the API

    same as "faust2api -ios"
